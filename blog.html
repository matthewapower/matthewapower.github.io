			<h1>Discovering The Brand <span style='float: right; color: pink;'>June 20, 2017</span></h1>
			<p>I recently started exploring the idea of brand design. It’s a very different area of design but one that resonates with me deeply.</p>
			<p>I have always been a huge fan of clothing from my skateboarding days in middle school through my years of playing in bands through  high school and college. The way I dress has always been a way I have expressed myself. There have been many questionable choices but ultimately I have enjoyed every fashion endeavor I have gotten myself into. What drew me to specific clothes over others? It usually comes down to branding. It’s not hard to find cheaper alternatives to fashion items but do they really mean the same thing?</p>
			<p>Branding is telling a story. It’s truly an art. Why do so many people flock to Starbucks over Dunkin Donuts? In my opinion Dunkin Donuts has better coffee but I continue to go to Starbucks every time. The stories they tell are different. Why do people buy Apple machines over comparable much cheaper HP machines? It’s the story they tell. Some people might disagree and say that those products are more of status symbols and a perceived level of affluence. To that I would say that yes, that might be the case, but the only reason they have become status symbols is because influential people bought into the story they are telling. Genuine brand storytelling and organic influencer adoption is very easy to differentiate from artificial influencer adoption. </p>
			<p>With all that being said, I have always wanted to start a clothing line. I have grown up being fueled by Jazz. Specifically I have been heavily influenced by Miles  Davis, John Coltrane, Charlie Parker, and Dizzy Gillespie. I  want to take this spirit and what it means to me and communicate that through clothing. This is not going to be Jazz inspired graphic T’s. It’s going to built more around the idea of art, conflict/resolution, and originality. Bebop jazz is structured as a rhythm section holding down a chord progression while a performer performs an improvised solo. The clothes I want to wear would be the rhythm section. They provide the structure and order for the person to be more truly themselves. Two people can solo in the same song and it be unique and true to themselves. Outfits can be seen in the same way. I want to found a brand that is focused on helping people be more true to themselves.</p>
			<p>This is only a small idea I have at the moment. We’ll see if I do anything with it.</p>

			<h1>Discovering Design <span style='float: right; color: pink;'>June 12, 2017</span></h1>
			<p>Starting a career is one of the biggest feats for a college student. As I started nearing the end of my time a Kennesaw State I started to freak out a little bit. I had only been a working musician until this point and work was starting to dry up as I lost the desire to always be traveling. This lead me down a trail towards discovering new career opportunities. I have always wanted to be a designer. That job title always sounded so cool to me.</p>
			<p>There are so many different ways it could could go. Fast forward a year and I found myself working as a web designer and front end developer at a company in Atlanta. That story is pretty crazy but I'll save it for another time (I'm riding in the blessed mobile because it has nothing to do with my skill or talent). The web is a great place for design. We spend a good portion of our day on computers now a days so what we're looking at should be beautiful and enjoyable but this is only one of my interests with design. I aspire to try my hand at several different kinds of design and chase after the one that best suits me.</p>
			<p>The purpose of this blog is to discover what design is and how it can be manifested in many different ways. I also want to take this opportunity to challenge myself. I want to have a deliverable for each type of design I explore. This will not only be fun research but putting it to the test and seeing if I'm even remotely interested in pursuing it further.</p>
			<p>For this first week I am going to cheat and focus on web design and a project I was really pleased with. This first project I will show is a website I did at work for a movement set out to end modern day slavery. It was a great opportunity because how often do you get to make something that has potential to drive a lot of traffic and focus the attention on doing something good?</p>
			<p>This was a huge learning experience for me because all of my design chops at the time were very raw and I was heavily influenced by personal interests so I got to bring some unconventional ideas into the web medium. My favorite part about projects like this is conveying the a in an intriguing and beautiful way.</p>
