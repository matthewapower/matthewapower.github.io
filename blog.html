			<h1>Discovering Design <span style='float: right; color: pink;'>June 12, 2017</span></h1>
			<p>Starting a career is one of the biggest feats for a college student. As I started nearing the end of my time a Kennesaw State I started to freak out a little bit. I had only been a working musician until this point and work was starting to dry up as I lost the desire to always be traveling. This lead me down a trail towards discovering new career opportunities. I have always wanted to be a designer. That job title always sounded so cool to me.</p>
			<p>There are so many different ways it could could go. Fast forward a year and I found myself working as a web designer and front end developer at a company in Atlanta. That story is pretty crazy but I'll save it for another time (I'm riding in the blessed mobile because it has nothing to do with my skill or talent). The web is a great place for design. We spend a good portion of our day on computers now a days so what we're looking at should be beautiful and enjoyable but this is only one of my interests with design. I aspire to try my hand at several different kinds of design and chase after the one that best suits me.</p>
			<p>The purpose of this blog is to discover what design is and how it can be manifested in many different ways. I also want to take this opportunity to challenge myself. I want to have a deliverable for each type of design I explore. This will not only be fun research but putting it to the test and seeing if I'm even remotely interested in pursuing it further.</p>
			<p>For this first week I am going to cheat and focus on web design and a project I was really pleased with. This first project I will show is a website I did at work for a movement set out to end modern day slavery. It was a great opportunity because how often do you get to make something that has potential to drive a lot of traffic and focus the attention on doing something good?</p>
			<p>This was a huge learning experience for me because all of my design chops at the time were very raw and I was heavily influenced by personal interests so I got to bring some unconventional ideas into the web medium. My favorite part about projects like this is conveying the a in an intriguing and beautiful way.</p>
